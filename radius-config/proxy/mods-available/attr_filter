#  This file defines a number of instances of the "attr_filter" module.
#

# attr_filter - filters the attributes received in replies from
# proxied servers, to make sure we send back to our RADIUS client
# only allowed attributes.
attr_filter attr_filter.post-proxy {
	key = "%{Realm}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/post-proxy
}

# attr_filter - filters the attributes in the packets we send to
# the RADIUS home servers.
attr_filter attr_filter.pre-proxy {
	key = "%{Realm}"
	filename = ${modconfdir}/${.:name}/pre-proxy
}
